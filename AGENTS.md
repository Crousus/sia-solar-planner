## What this project is

**Solar Planner** — a single-user browser tool for sketching PV installations on satellite imagery. The user:

1. Navigates a Leaflet satellite map to their building
2. Locks the map (snapshots zoom/lat → computes meters-per-pixel)
3. Draws roof polygons by clicking vertices
4. Sets per-roof tilt and panel orientation (portrait/landscape)
5. Places individual panels on roofs — they snap to a grid aligned with the roof's long edge and stay inside the polygon
6. Creates strings, drags a lasso to assign panels; panels are auto-numbered to indicate wiring direction
7. Assigns strings to inverters
8. Exports an A4 landscape PDF with the plan + string-to-inverter table

No backend. Everything lives in `localStorage`; JSON export/import handles portability.

## Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Build | Vite 5 | Default React-TS template config |
| UI | React 18 + TypeScript (strict) | Functional components, hooks only |
| Canvas | `react-konva` + `konva` | Object-level drag/click/hitbox on a single Stage |
| Map | `react-leaflet` + `leaflet` | ESRI World Imagery tiles, no API key |
| State | `zustand` with `persist` | localStorage key: `solar-planner-project` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + a little inline `<style>` | No component library |
| PDF | `jspdf` + `html2canvas` | Client-side; tile CORS may prevent capturing the map layer — code falls back to canvas only |

## Dev commands

```bash
npm install      # once
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build (used as CI-style check)
npx tsc --noEmit # typecheck only
```

There are no tests or linters configured. Typecheck + `npm run build` is the acceptance gate.

## Architecture

### State flow

Everything non-visual is in the single Zustand store (`useProjectStore`). Components subscribe to slices with selectors (`useProjectStore((s) => s.project.panels)`). Actions are exposed as store methods — **never mutate state directly**; always go through a setter so `persist` fires.

```
User input
  │

Component event handler
  │
  ▼
store.someAction(args)         ← all mutation lives here
  │
  ▼
Zustand sets state; persist middleware writes to localStorage
  │
  ▼
Subscribed components re-render
```

Two kinds of state:
- **Persistent** (`project`): roofs, panels, strings, inverters, panelType, mapState
- **Ephemeral** (`toolMode`, `selectedRoofId`, `activeStringId`): not persisted (see `partialize` in the store)

### Coordinate system

**Critical**: canvas coordinates are Leaflet container pixels at the moment the map was locked. Everything (roof vertices, panel centers, lasso rects) is stored in that pixel space.

- `mapState.metersPerPixel` (mpp) is the calibration — set once by `lockMap` using `metersPerPixel(zoom, lat)` from `utils/calibration.ts`
- To convert pixels → meters: multiply by `mpp`
- The Konva Stage is a full-size overlay positioned over the Leaflet container, with `pointer-events: none` when map unlocked and `pointer-events: auto` when a tool mode is active (see `.konva-overlay-active` / `-passive` in `index.css`)

### Tilt projection (the tricky math)

The satellite view is the **horizontal projection** of a sloped roof. Panels mounted on the slope appear compressed along the slope direction. In this project the convention is:

- The roof's "long axis" (longest edge) is taken as **horizontal** (no compression)
- The **perpendicular** axis is the slope direction → compressed by `cos(tiltDeg)`

`panelDisplaySize(panelType, roof, mpp)` in `utils/geometry.ts` is the single source of truth:

```
portrait:
  displayW = panelType.widthM  / mpp        // short side, along roof long axis
  displayH = panelType.heightM * cos(tilt) / mpp   // long side, up the slope

landscape:
  displayW = panelType.heightM / mpp
  displayH = panelType.widthM  * cos(tilt) / mpp
```

**If you change the tilt model, change it here and only here** — every component reads from this function.

### Panel grid snapping

`snapPanelToGrid()` in `utils/geometry.ts`:

1. Compute the roof's primary angle (longest edge → atan2)
2. Rotate cursor into the roof-local frame (origin = polygon centroid)
3. Snap to nearest multiple of `displayW × displayH` (the cell size)
4. Rotate back to canvas frame
5. Reject if any of the panel's 4 corners is outside the polygon
6. Reject if within `0.7 × min(cellW, cellH)` of any existing panel center on that roof

Returns `null` on rejection → caller draws a red ghost.

### String numbering

`renumberStrings()` (bottom of `store/projectStore.ts`) is called **after any mutation that affects a string's membership** (assign, unassign, delete panel, delete roof). It sorts panels within a string by `(descending cy, ascending cx)` = bottom-to-top, left-to-right — i.e. the standard solar-string snake starting at the lower-left — and rewrites `indexInString`.

Any new mutation that touches `panel.stringId` must call `renumberStrings` on the affected string ids. See `assignPanelsToString` for the pattern.

### Tool modes

`ToolMode` is a tagged string union: `'idle' | 'draw-roof' | 'place-panels' | 'assign-string' | 'delete'`.

- The Toolbar sets mode via `setToolMode`
- `KonvaOverlay` gates its pointer handlers on `toolMode`
- Mode buttons are disabled when the map isn't locked
- `Escape` key resets to `idle` and clears in-progress drawing/lasso

Each mode's event handling lives in `KonvaOverlay.tsx` except:
- `place-panels`'s ghost rendering and click-to-place handler are in `PanelLayer.tsx` (because the ghost needs access to the selected roof + panel type)
- `delete` is handled by individual shape `onClick`/`onContextMenu` in `RoofLayer.tsx` and `PanelLayer.tsx`

### Event bubbling gotcha

Konva events bubble from shape → Stage. Shape handlers set `e.cancelBubble = true` when they want to stop the Stage handler from firing (e.g. clicking a roof to select it shouldn't add a roof-draw vertex). Check existing code in `RoofLayer.tsx` and `PanelLayer.tsx` before adding new shape clicks.

## Adding a feature — quick recipes

### New persisted field on a Roof
1. Add field to `Roof` interface in `types/index.ts`
2. Add a default in `addRoof()` in `store/projectStore.ts`
3. If mutable, add a setter or use `updateRoof(id, changes)`
4. Render control in `Sidebar.tsx` under the selected-roof section

### New tool mode
1. Add the literal to the `ToolMode` union
2. Add a button in `Toolbar.tsx` (`MODES` array + handler, and a keyboard shortcut in `App.tsx`)
3. Gate rendering/handlers in `KonvaOverlay.tsx` (or the relevant layer)
4. Make sure `Escape` resets it (already handled if you follow the pattern)

### New PDF section
PDF layout is hand-coded mm arithmetic in `utils/pdfExport.ts`. The left pane is the composited canvas image; the right pane is the string table + totals. Add rows by incrementing `cursorY`. Page is `297 × 210 mm`, margins `8 mm`.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict** is on; no implicit any
- Prefer **named exports** for utilities, **default** for components
- Keep components pure — **no side effects outside effects/event handlers**
- Selectors should return the smallest slice needed (don't destructure the whole project)
- Don't import from `store/projectStore` into `utils/*` — utilities are pure
- Ids are short random strings (`uid()` in the store); no UUID library
- Comments: only when the WHY isn't obvious. Don't restate the code
- New files under `src/components` use PascalCase; utilities use camelCase

## Known limits / non-goals

- **No Undo/Redo** — deferred
- **No multi-select of panels** — one at a time
- **No rotation of the panel grid independent of the roof** — panels always align to the roof's longest edge
- **No non-map mode calibration** — drawing only works after locking a map
- **Map tile PDF capture can fail silently** (CORS); falls back to canvas-only plan. The console warns
- The Konva Stage is a single layer for simplicity; if perf ever becomes an issue, split static (roofs) and dynamic (ghost/lasso) onto separate `<Layer>`s

## Pitfalls that have already bitten

- `leaflet` optional `tap` property isn't typed on `L.Map` — cast via `unknown` (see `MapView.tsx`)
- The Zustand `persist` middleware writes the full `project` on every state change; don't put transient state inside `project` or you'll write every mousemove
- Don't forget to call `renumberStrings()` when you touch `panel.stringId` — silent off-by-one numbering is the failure mode
- Konva shape clicks bubble to the Stage by default — set `e.cancelBubble = true` in shape handlers when needed

## Where to start reading

If you're new to the codebase, read in this order:

1. `src/types/index.ts` — the full data model in ~60 lines
2. `src/store/projectStore.ts` — every state transition
3. `src/utils/geometry.ts` — the spatial math
4. `src/components/KonvaOverlay.tsx` — the interaction state machine
5. `src/components/Toolbar.tsx` + `Sidebar.tsx` — user-facing controls
6. `src/utils/pdfExport.ts` — export layout
